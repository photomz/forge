# Actors

The actors module contains the core components for model training and inference in TorchForge. This includes policy actors, reference models, replay buffers, and trainers.

## Policy Actor

The policy actor is responsible for model inference and policy interactions during training.

## Reference Model

The reference model provides baseline comparisons for reinforcement learning algorithms.

## Replay Buffer

The replay buffer manages storage and sampling of training experiences.

## Trainer

The trainer orchestrates the training process and implements training algorithms.
