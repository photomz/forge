# Get Started

Welcome to TorchForge! This guide will help you get up and running with TorchForge, a PyTorch-native platform specifically designed for post-training generative AI models.

TorchForge specializes in post-training techniques for large language models, including:

- **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**: Adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks using labeled data
- **Generalized Reward Policy Optimization (GRPO)**: Advanced reinforcement learning for model alignment
- **Multi-GPU Distributed Training**: Efficient scaling across multiple GPUs and nodes
