## Zero to Forge: From RL Theory to Production-Scale Implementation

A comprehensive guide for ML Engineers building distributed RL systems for language models.

Some of the examples mentioned below will be conceptual in nature for understanding. Please refer to API Docs (Coming Soon!) for more details

Welcome to the Tutorials section! This section is inspired by the A-Z PyTorch tutorial, shoutout to our PyTorch friends that remember!

This section currently is structured in 3 detailed parts:

1. [RL Fundamentals and Understanding Forge Terminology](./1_RL_and_Forge_Fundamentals.MD): This gives a quick refresher of Reinforcement Learning and teaches you Forge Fundamentals
2. [Forge Internals](./2_Forge_Internals.MD): Goes a layer deeper and explains the internals of Forge
3. [Monarch 101](./3_Monarch_101.MD): It's a 101 to Monarch and how Forge Talks to Monarch

Each part builds upon the next and the entire section can be consumed in roughly an hour-Grab a Chai and Enjoy!

If you're eager, please checkout our SFT Tutorial too (Coming soon!) as well as [App Examples](../../apps/).
