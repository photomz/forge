# Contributing to forge
We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible.



## Coding Style
`forge` uses pre-commit hooks to ensure style consistency and prevent common mistakes. Enable it by:

```
pre-commit install
```
Ater this pre-commit hooks will be run before every commit.

You can also run this manually on every file using:

```
pre-commit run --all-files
```
