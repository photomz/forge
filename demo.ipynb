    "# Intro to Forge\n",
    "\n",
    "Forge is a PyTorch-native framework designed for rapid experimentation and large-scale training of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms with Large Language Models (LLMs). It's designed to:\n",
    "- Express RL algorithms as naturally as psuedocode, while scaling seamlessly across clusters\n",
    "- Support varying degrees of asynchrony - from fully synchronous/on-policy, to fully asynchronous/off-policy training\n",
    "- Separate infrastructural concerns from algorithmic implementation\n",
    "- Bias towards composable, reusable components that can be mixed and matched for different RL approaches\n",

    "Forge is built on top of proven components:\n",
    "- **[Monarch](https://github.com/meta-pytorch/monarch)** - PyTorch-native single-controller framework\n",

    "### Defining an Actor\n",
    "At its core, Monarch uses [actors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Actor_model) as a way to create multi-machine programs. Actors are Python objects that expose a number of endpoint functions. These functions can be called by other actors in the system and their responses gathered asynchronously."

    "\n",

    "One important area we haven't covered yet is how Forge separates the **control plane** (service coordination) from the **data plane** (tensor transfers). You might reasonably wonder about performance implications if all data flows through TCP in a service-based architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "We're actively developing **TorchStore** - our solution for high-performance tensor storage and retrieval over high-bandwidth interconnects like RDMA. This separation ensures that while Forge services handle coordination and routing, heavy tensor operations bypass the service layer entirely.\n",
